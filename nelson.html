    <hr><h2 style="color:red;">YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT TO EAT BEFORE HITTING THE GYM?</h2>
    We live in an age where people take working out at the gym very seriously but in numerous cases,they move to their gym on an empty stomach either because they have succumbed to the notion that one should'nt eat before workout simply because they don't know what to eat.But this doesn't mean that ypu comdown heartily before your workout either. The key is to follow a middle path i.e. eating at the right time.
     <p>Fitness expert Namrata Purohit explains, "Exercising with a full stomach is not ideal therefore eating at the right time is important. Even an empty stomach distract a person during workout. The major source of fuel for the body is carbohydrates. Therefore, one must have easily digestable carbohydrates that can can help prevent the hunger during
  exercise and give you energy."</p>
  <b>Here is a list of foods that are considerd ideal to eat before a workout:</b>
  
  <ol type="i">
      <li><b>Brown rice with chicken and their Ingredients as well.</b></li>
     <p>Many people work out in the mornings before heading to work or college, there are those who hit the gym in the evenings or at the night due to time constraints.
      For them, having brown rice with chicken is a good option. Nutritionist Dr Zainab Sayed explains , "Brown rice is absorbed slowly and a good source of fibre and carbs while chicken ia an ldeal form of lean meat and protein. Thus, making this combination ideal before a workout. You would require about 200 to 300 calories hence, you can eat about one medium size bowel of brown rice (30 gm uncooked brown rice) with two pices of chicken."</p>

      </b> <img width="200"Ingredients height="300" src="Ingredient.png">
      <li><b>Granola bars</b></li>
       <p>Eating a pre-exercise bar means you'll have more reserves during a workout."Energy bars usually have carbs, which is what gives energy to the body. However, make sure your energy /granola bar has minimum amount of fat,protens and fibre,"says Nelson.
      <img width="400" height="300" src="Granola-Bars.jpg">
      <li>
        <b>yoghurt</b>
        <p>cards or dahi contain calcium and protens and abit of natural sugar present in small quantities. Because it is easy on the stomach and the digestive system,it is a great option to consume it before an intense workout. Adding some whole grain cereal, frouts or honey to yoghurt will give you a quick energy boost.</p>
